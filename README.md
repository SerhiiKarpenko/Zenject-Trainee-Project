# What is Zenject
Zenject is a dependency injection framework designed specifically for Unity 3D, but it can also be used outside of Unity. It enables developers to break down their application into smaller, loosely coupled components with clearly defined responsibilities, and then easily combine and configure these components in various ways. This approach makes it simpler to write, reuse, refactor, and test code, resulting in a scalable and highly flexible architecture. Zenject is lightweight and highly performant, making it an ideal choice for Unity developers who need to create complex applications.

# Overview
This is a very simple project in which you play as a green capsule and can walk on the platform by clicking on it with your mouse. When you touch the red capsules (enemies), they immediately disappear and the player loses health points.
